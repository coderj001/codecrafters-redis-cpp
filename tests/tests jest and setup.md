coderj001: Impl #file:tests jest and support for ping and echo command tests

GitHub Copilot: I'll read the test files and the command handler/source to see what's missing and what to implement so the Jest tests for PING and ECHO can pass. I'll fetch the relevant files (tests and server/handler sources). Expected outcome: I get the test expectations and current implementation to plan changes. I'll read the remaining test files and the RESP parser headers to confirm what's missing and what tests expect next. I'll fetch `cli.e2e.test.js`, `test-redis-cli.js`, `include/resp_parser.h`, and resp_parser.cpp. Expected outcome: know exactly which tests to add and whether server supports PING/ECHO. I'll update the C++ handler to return a simple-string for PING and add Jest tests for PING and ECHO in both the node client tests and the redis-cli tests; outcome: tests for PING/ECHO will be present and server returns PONG as a simple string. I'll apply three edits.

```


Made changes.


```

I'll add tests for PING and ECHO to server.e2e.test.js and test-redis-cli.js so Jest covers them; then I'll run a quick test run (but I will just modify files now).

```


Made changes.


```

Now I'll add PING/ECHO checks to the redis-cli based test runner test-redis-cli.js. This will call redis-cli ping and echo commands and verify outputs. I'll read test-redis-cli.js to find the correct insertion point for adding PING/ECHO tests. I'll insert a new PING/ECHO test function and add it to the runAllTests list in test-redis-cli.js. This will check redis-cli's PING and ECHO outputs.

```


Made changes.


```

I'll update runAllTests to include the new test.

```


Made changes.


```

Checkpoint: I changed server response for PING to simple string and added PING/ECHO tests in both server.e2e.test.js and test-redis-cli.js. Next I'll run unit tests (Jest) to validate. I'll run npm test in the tests folder if package.json has test script, otherwise run jest directly. I'll run `npm test` at repo root. I'll implement Jest tests for PING and ECHO and make the C++ server return the correct RESP for PING; next I'll summarize what I changed, what I ran, the failure, and recommended next steps.

Checklist (requirements)

- Add Jest tests (node client) for PING and ECHO in server.e2e.test.js — Done
- Add redis-cli-based tests for PING and ECHO in test-redis-cli.js — Done
- Make server return correct RESP for `PING` (PONG as a simple string) — Done
- Run build/tests to verify — Attempted (Build failed due to missing cmake)

Files changed

- handle_command.cpp — PING now returns a simple string ("+PONG\r\n") per Redis behavior.
- server.e2e.test.js — added tests using node redis client: `PING` and `ECHO`.
- test-redis-cli.js — added `testPingEcho()` and included it in `runAllTests()` for redis-cli checks.

What I ran and results

- Ran project tests: npm test
  - Output: Build step failed. run-e2e-tests.sh invoked cmake but cmake was not found.
  - Error excerpt: "./run-e2e-tests.sh: line 6: cmake: command not found" — build failed, so Jest/JS tests that require the built server couldn't run.

Why the failure blocks verification

- The Jest tests and the redis-cli runner spawn the built server binary at `build/server`. The repository's test script triggers a build (CMake) before running tests. Without CMake present, the server binary isn't built and tests can't start the server to exercise PING/ECHO.

Recommended next steps (pick one)

1. Install CMake (recommended, macOS Homebrew)

   - In your shell (nu), run:
     ```
     brew install cmake
     ```
   - Then from repo root:
     ```
     cd /Users/raju/Develop/CppProject/codecrafters-redis-cpp
     npm test
     ```
     These commands are compatible with your nu shell.

2. If you prefer not to install CMake, run tests against an already-running Redis server:

   - Start a system Redis (e.g., `brew install redis && redis-server --port 6379`) and skip the repo build.
   - Modify the test helpers to connect to an external Redis (or run only redis-cli tests that target localhost). I can help adapt tests to optionally use an external server.

3. If you'd like, I can also:
   - Add a small npm-only smoke test (pure JS) that doesn't require building the C++ server so CI can run some checks without native build. Tell me if you want that.

Quality gates / status

- Build: FAIL (cmake missing) — blocks running the e2e tests
- Tests added: PASS (code added), but not executed yet because build failed
- Lint/Typecheck: N/A (no changes that trigger build tools)
- Requirements coverage: All requested code & tests implemented — Done but unverified due to environment/build issue.

If you want, I can:

- Re-run the tests after you install cmake, or
- Implement a fallback test mode that uses an external Redis server (fast), or
- Try to build the server in the current environment if you give permission to install cmake (I cannot install software here, but I can run build commands if tools are available).

Which of the options above do you want me to take next? These commands are compatible with your nu shell.

coderj001: #file:test-redis-cli.js help me understand the code

GitHub Copilot: Here's a concise walkthrough of test-redis-cli.js:

Purpose

- Launch your Redis server (via `RedisServerTester`), then exercise commands using the real `redis-cli` executable (through `npx redis-cli`), asserting basic correctness and error behavior.

Key Components

- Class `RedisCliTester`: Orchestrates starting the server and running a suite of CLI-based tests.
- Method `runRedisCliCommand(args)`: Spawns `npx redis-cli -p 6379 <args>`, captures stdout, enforces a 5s timeout, resolves trimmed stdout on exit code 0, rejects otherwise.

Test Methods (each returns boolean)

1. `testBasicSetGet()`: Verifies `SET key value` then `GET key` returns the value.
2. `testNonExistentKey()`: `GET nonexistent_key` should yield `(nil)` (or empty string fallback).
3. `testOverwriteValue()`: Ensures a second `SET` overwrites the previous value.
4. `testMultipleKeys()`: Sets three keys, fetches each, checks all match.
5. `testPingEcho()`: Runs `PING` expecting `PONG`, then `ECHO <msg>` expecting the same message.
6. `testErrorHandling()`: Confirms errors for `GET` with no key and `SET` missing a value (relies on non‑zero exit from redis-cli).

Aggregation

- `runAllTests()`: Executes the above in sequence; collects booleans; final success is logical AND of all.
- `runTests()`: Starts the server (through `RedisServerTester.startServer()`), runs the suite, logs summary, cleans up.

Process / Control Flow

1. Instantiate `RedisCliTester`.
2. Start server (spawns your compiled C++ server binary indirectly).
3. Sequentially run each test (no parallelism—simplifies ordering and avoids race conditions).
4. Clean up: stop server regardless of success/failure.

Error Handling Patterns

- Each test wraps logic in try/catch, logs a friendly ✓ / ✗ marker.
- Expected command errors are validated by attempting a call and ensuring it throws (non-zero exit from redis-cli).
- Timeout guard kills hung processes after 5s.

Why use `npx redis-cli`

- Ensures a local (possibly dev-dependency) redis-cli is used if available, avoiding reliance on a globally installed binary.

Output Normalization

- `stdout.trim()` is used; comparisons are strict (e.g., exact `'PONG'`, exact echoed string).
- For non-existent key, allows `(nil)` or empty string to be lenient early in development.

Potential Edge Cases Not Yet Covered

- Binary / large bulk strings
- Concurrent writes
- Expiration or other Redis commands
- PING with payload (Redis supports optional PING message returning that message)

Possible Improvements (optional)

- Add assertion helpers to reduce repetition.
- Distinguish between protocol errors vs process errors (parse stderr).
- Add retry logic if server not yet ready instead of assuming immediate readiness after start (currently relies on `RedisServerTester` doing that).

Let me know if you want a diagram or suggestions for extending it.
